# Welcome to the Sanity Studio!

Sanity is a cloud based content platform that offers a slew of tools & features. The Sanity Studio is the brand new Content Management System we'll be using at HTC to manage web & marketing content (herefore refered to as the Studio). The Studio is an open-source tool that's incredibly customizable which will allows us to craft a tool that works exactly how we need it to! If any questions arise, please email the Web & Digital Media Manager [here](mailto:jacob.stordahl@hennepintech.edu). Let's take a look around!

## Dashboard

If you're reading this, the screen you're currently on is the Dashboard. This dashboard provides a way for the Web team to deliver updates & other resources to content owners within the CMS interface. In the future we will aim to develop additional plugins that display analytics, Salesforce data, and other resources.

## Desk

In the main navigation you'll see a button for the 'Desk' - this is where all content editing takes place. Content is organized based on category and consists of one-of-many data types (like blog posts, events, academic programs, etc), and one-of-one types (like landing pages, global site settings, etc).

## Media Library

The media library is where all media files can be updated, and then referenced in any document. When uploading images to the Media Library, please also fill out all of the additional meta fields, especially the alt text field. This keeps all approved images/ files in one place, and makes sure they are accessible wherever they are referenced.
